Post-Installation System Requirements

1. Create a Public Group named Lead Alert and include all users who should receive new lead notifications.

2. Add the LeadAlertLwc component to the Utility Bar of your Salesforce App by navigating to:
   Setup > App Manager > Edit (desired App) > Utility Bar.
   Note: Utility Bars in managed packages are typically non-editable, and alerts may not function as expected. It is recommended to use a custom App for this 
   configuration.

3. Assign the Lead Alert Permission Set to all users who are members of the Lead Alert Public Group.

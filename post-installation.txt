===========Post-Installation System Requirements=======

1. Add a Public Group called Lead Alert and add members to it, who are supposed to receive new lead alerts.

2. Add the Permission Set named Lead Alert Permission Set to the users, who are in the Lead Alert - Public Group.

3. Finally add the LeadAlertLwc component to your Salesforce App's Utility Bar via Setup > App Manager > Edit (App) > Utility Bar.
   (Note: Utility Bar in managed App might not be editable and alerts would not work, hence choose to add to and use a custom App.)
